Create a mini-system for student management.

Each student must have a unique ID, first name, last name, and a list of courses they are enrolled in. The system should provide the ability to add new students and remove them. The system should allow adding students to courses. Courses may be required and may be chosen.  Each student can only be enrolled in a limited number of courses.The system should provide an opportunity to obtain the overall average mark of each student. Some students who has more than 75 points have a scholarship. If a studentâ€™s average mark is more than 90 then the student has a scholarship 35% more. 

Requirements:

All data should be stored in collections (DB is not required).
All validations should be implemented. 
Unit tests should be added (JUnit).
SOLID principles should be followed when developing the system.
Git should be added.  You should create a git repository on Github, create a separate branch for the task development and then create a PR and add me as a reviewer.
